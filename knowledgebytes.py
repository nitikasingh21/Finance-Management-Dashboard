    st.write("2. Create a Budget: Track your income and expenses by creating a budget.

Use the dashboard to make this process easier and more organized.")
    st.write("3. Prioritize Savings- Treat savings as a non-negotiable expense in your budget. Aim to save a percentage of your income regularly, even if it's a small amount initially.

Monitor your spending habits and identify areas where you can cut back or reduce expenses.")

    st.write("- The Rule of 72 is a simple way to estimate how long an investment will take to double at a given fixed annual rate of interest.

This rule underscores the importance of choosing investments with higher returns to accelerate wealth accumulation.")
